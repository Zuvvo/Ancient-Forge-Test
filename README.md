Ancient Forge Unity Test Project
==================

## Getting Started

Run project with Unity 2022.3.60f1

### 1. Architectural choices

I decided to implement my own UI-model data binding methods. Same for dependency injection. For such small project it was needed to use and additional library or package.

### 2. What should be done but wasn't

For a small sample project like this it wasn't necessary to implement tests and many checks to validate input data. This project is very prone to bugs when wrong data is set.


### 3. What would I use but didn't have time for it

Since I am currently working on Unity 2021 and didn't have this feature I really wanted to try UI Toolkit because it is more familiar for me to create UI in a web-dev way.
